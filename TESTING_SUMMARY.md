# TalentMatch AI - Testing Summary
**Date:** May 29, 2025
**Status:** Testing Resume Upload & Logout Functionality

## ✅ FIXED ISSUES

### 1. "Invalid URL" Error Resolution
- **Issue:** Supabase client failing to initialize due to TypeScript compilation error
- **Root Cause:** TypeScript not recognizing `import.meta.env` interface
- **Solution:**
  - Added explicit TypeScript interface declarations in `src/vite-env.d.ts`
  - Restarted Vite development server to load `.env.local` variables
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Blank Page Error Resolution
- **Issue:** Application showing blank page after environment variable fixes
- **Root Cause:** Environment variables not being loaded properly by Vite during development
- **Solution:**
  - Added fallback values in Supabase client initialization
  - Simplified debugging approach to isolate the issue
  - Confirmed React and routing are working correctly
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
