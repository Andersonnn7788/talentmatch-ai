## üîß Next Steps Required

### Critical Database Setup (Manual Steps)

The resume upload functionality requires manual setup in Supabase dashboard:

#### Step 1: Add Resume Fields to Database
Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Add resume fields to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS resume_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS resume_file_path TEXT;
```

#### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Click "Create a new bucket"
3. Name: `documents`
4. Set as **Public**
5. Click "Create bucket"

#### Step 3: Set Up Storage Policies
Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Storage policies for resume uploads
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload resumes" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'documents' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'resumes'
  AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view resumes" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'resumes'
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their resumes" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'resumes'
  AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their resumes" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'resumes'
  AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
);
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Database Setup Verification
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8083/test`
2. Click "Run Setup Check" button
3. Review the results - any missing components will show SQL to run
4. Copy and run the provided SQL in Supabase dashboard

### 2. Resume Upload Testing
Once all setup checks pass:
1. The resume upload component will appear on the test page
2. Try uploading a PDF, DOC, or DOCX file (max 5MB)
3. Verify file appears in Supabase Storage ‚Üí documents bucket ‚Üí resumes folder
4. Test file deletion functionality

### 3. Logout Functionality Testing
1. Log in to the application
2. Click on user avatar in top navigation
3. Dropdown menu should appear with logout option
4. Click logout to test sign-out functionality

## üìÅ Key Files
